# 🌿 MJ Ahmad — Nexara Ethical Hub

Welcome to the ethical heart of Nexara.

This repository is not just a collection of files.  
It is a living testament to a vision:  
That governance can be incorruptible,  
That identity can be dignified,  
And that documentation can be permanent, transparent, and just.
