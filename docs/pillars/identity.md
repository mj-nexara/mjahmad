# ðŸ§¾ Decentralized Identity

Decentralized Identity (DID) ensures that every participant in Nexara is sovereign, verifiable, and protected.

## âœ¨ Core Principles

- **Self-sovereignty over surveillance**
- **Verifiable credentials over centralized IDs**
- **Privacy with proof**

## ðŸ”§ Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **NexID Vault** | DID-based identity vault with signature verification |
| **Guardian Profiles** | DID-linked identity for community guardians |
| **NexID Passport** (future) | Verifiable credentials for governance roles |

## ðŸ§­ Purpose

To ensure that identity is not a gatekeeper, but a gateway to dignity.
