# MJ's Ethical Principles

These principles guide every decision, design, and deployment within Nexara:

- **Dignity First** — Every system must respect the individual.
- **Transparency by Default** — Nothing hidden, everything verifiable.
- **Consent over Control** — Governance must be participatory, not imposed.
- **Resilience through Decentralization** — Power must be distributed, not concentrated.
- **Purpose before Profit** — Technology must serve people, not exploit them.
