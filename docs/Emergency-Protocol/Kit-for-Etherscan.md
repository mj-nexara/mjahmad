Dear Etherscan Team,

As a developer with lived experience in technical resilience, I’ve designed tools like StruggleSync (an offline ledger for survival-led strategies) and LumID (a DID-powered engine for personal declaration). These projects stem from real hardship and reflect not just code—but conviction.

Your platform stands at the frontier of decentralized transparency. I believe my work aligns with your values and vision, and I’m ready to contribute—not just professionally, but personally—to Etherscan’s ethical journey forward.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,  
MJ Ahmad

These projects reflect both technical resilience and personal conviction.
